# Pastebin Lite

Pastebin Lite is a minimal Pastebin-style web application that allows users to create text pastes and share them via a unique URL.  
Each paste can optionally expire after a given time (TTL) or after a specified number of views.

The application exposes REST APIs for creating and retrieving pastes and also provides an HTML page to view a paste in the browser.
